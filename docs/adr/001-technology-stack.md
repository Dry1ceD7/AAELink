# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
AAELink v2 requires a modern, performant, and maintainable technology stack that supports:
- High-performance real-time messaging
- Offline-first capabilities
- Enterprise-grade security
- Multi-platform deployment (web, desktop, mobile)
- On-premise deployment
- Scalability for 200+ concurrent users

## Decision
We have selected the following technology stack:

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Bun (latest) - Chosen for superior performance and built-in TypeScript support
- **Framework**: Hono - Lightweight, fast, and designed for edge computing
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 with Drizzle ORM - Enterprise-grade RDBMS with excellent FTS support
- **Cache**: Redis 7 - Industry-standard for session management and caching
- **File Storage**: MinIO - S3-compatible object storage for on-premise deployment
- **Real-time**: WebSocket (native) - Direct control over real-time messaging

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 - Mature ecosystem, excellent component model
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS - Utility-first, highly customizable, excellent DX
- **State**: Zustand + React Query - Simple yet powerful state management
- **Desktop**: Tauri 2.0 - Lightweight, secure, native performance
- **Mobile**: React Native (Expo) - Code reuse, rapid development

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose - Standard for container orchestration
- **Observability**: SigNoz - Open-source, on-premise APM solution
- **Workflow**: n8n - Self-hosted automation platform
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions - Integrated with repository

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Node.js + Express**: More mature but slower than Bun + Hono
2. **Deno + Fresh**: Good performance but smaller ecosystem
3. **Vue.js**: Simpler but smaller enterprise adoption
4. **Electron**: Heavier resource usage compared to Tauri
5. **Kubernetes**: Overkill for initial deployment scale
6. **Datadog/New Relic**: Cloud-based, not suitable for on-premise

## Consequences

### Positive
- Exceptional performance with Bun runtime
- Type safety throughout with TypeScript strict mode
- Modern developer experience
- Cost-effective on-premise deployment
- Full control over data and infrastructure
- Progressive Web App capabilities

### Negative
- Bun is relatively new (mitigated by Docker containerization)
- Team needs to learn Hono framework
- Tauri has smaller community than Electron
- Self-hosted observability requires maintenance

## Rollback Plan
If Bun proves unstable:
1. Port backend to Node.js 20+ (1-2 days effort)
2. Replace Hono with Fastify or Express
3. All other components remain unchanged
